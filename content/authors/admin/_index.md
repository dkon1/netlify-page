I love nature and quantitative modeling, and especially putting the two together. I teach quantitative skills to biology students; those include coding, mathematical modeling, and data analysis. I have taught high school students in Russia and medical professionals at an NIH course. Other passions include: music, both listening and playing; languages, both human and computer, labor unions in academia, and spending time with my family.
